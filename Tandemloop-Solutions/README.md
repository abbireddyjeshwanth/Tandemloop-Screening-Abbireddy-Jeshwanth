## Test Overview

This repository contains solutions to the **First Screening Test** assigned by **Tandemloop** as part of the hiring process for the role of Software Developer.  
The test includes 4 basic programming problems to evaluate foundational coding skills.

## Repository Structure

Each problem is implemented in a separate Python file as per the guidelines:

Problem-1.py: A class-based calculator performing Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide.
Problem-2.py: Generate an odd number series of `a` terms (e.g., 1, 3, 5...)
Problem-3.py: Generate odd numbers till position `a`, with controlled count.
Problem-4.py: Count how many numbers are divisible by 1–9 in a list.


## Problem Details

###  Problem 1 – Calculator using Class
A class-based calculator that takes inputs `a`, `b`, and `operation` to perform:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division  
Handles invalid operations and divide-by-zero cases.


### Problem 2 – Generate Odd Series (1, 3, 5, …)
For an input `a`, generate the first `a` odd numbers using list comprehension.

**Example:**
Input: 4  
Output: 1, 3, 5, 7


### Problem 3 – Patterned Odd Series Output
Generate a series similar to Problem-2, but the number of items printed depends on whether the input is even or odd.

**Example:**
Input: 6  
Output: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9


### Problem 4 – Count Divisibility
Given a list of integers, the program counts how many numbers are divisible by each digit from 1 to 9.

**Example:**
Input List: [1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 46, 76, 82, 15, 20, 30]  
Output: {1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, 4: 4, 5: 3, 6: 2, 7: 0, 8: 1, 9: 1}


## How to Run

Make sure Python 3.10+ is installed. Then run each file using:

```bash
python Problem-1.py
python Problem-2.py
python Problem-3.py
python Problem-4.py
```
